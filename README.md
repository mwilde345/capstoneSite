Website For Capstone

all the page files are in site.
view the site right now at http://capstone.mcwilde.com

While you are working on your page, just host it locally with xampp to view your changes.

I just got a static template off the web and changed the pages to php so I could include the header and footer.
There is some js at the top of the page files to do some page-specific modifications.

So all the pages have the original template filler data.

Once all the stuff is committed to the repo at the end I will push it to the server.
